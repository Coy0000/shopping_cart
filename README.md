# 🧾 Food & Price Tracker (Python CLI)

Welcome to the **Food & Price Tracker** — a simple Python command-line interface (CLI) program that lets you track food items and their prices, then calculates the total amount. Ideal for basic budgeting, groceries, or learning Python fundamentals.

## 🚀 Features

- Add unlimited food items with associated prices.
- Input validation to handle non-numeric entries.
- Displays a clean summary of all items and a final total.
- Runs entirely in the terminal.

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Start Input Loop**

2. **Quit Anytime**  
   Type `q` to exit the loop and display the total.

3. **Summary Output**  
   The program prints all the items with prices and calculates the grand total.
